# spotify_clone
This Spotify clone is a web application developed using HTML and CSS, mimicking the look and feel of the popular music streaming service. It features a responsive layout showcasing playlists, album covers, and user interactions. This project highlights my front-end development skills and ability to create visually appealing interfaces.
